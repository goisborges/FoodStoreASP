ASP.net food store


This code is being created during my ASP.NET classes for the Computer Programming course at Georgian College.

It's a basic food marketplace created using Visual Studio 2019/2022 for Mac and Windows. ASP.NET, C#.

The project connects to a local MSSql database and has Facebook authentication as well as direct database authentication.
